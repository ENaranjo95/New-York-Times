# My Awesome Project
This project was an introduction to my first week as becoming a week developer. I took a screenshot of the New York times and decide to replicate the webpage.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML and CSS

This project took a lot of time due to the very detail this project needed to look almost identical.


## Lessons Learned:

I learned that building the outline is very important before I can style the contents inside each section. Start with the big picture and move on to the little details.
